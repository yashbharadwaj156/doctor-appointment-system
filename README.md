Hey,there this project is made by me which aims:-
1-The purpose of DOCTOR APPOINTMENT SYSTEM is to automate the existing manual system by the help of computerized equipments and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that their valuable data/information can be stored for a longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same. 

2-DOCTOR APPOINTMENT SYSTEM, as described above, can lead to error free, secure, reliable and fast management system. It can assist the user to concentrate on their other activities rather to concentrate on the record keeping. Thus it will help organization in better utilization of resources.
